# IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION
The Iris flower dataset consists ot three species: setosa, versicolor,and virginica.
These species can be distinguished based on their measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species.
your objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species.

Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal and petal measurements.
this dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks.
